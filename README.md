# SmartBuff Wrath of the Lich King CLassic / Classic ERA and Classic Hardcore

For clarity, this repository is ONLY for the Classic version of the client as listed above, and it is not the Retail.

SmartBuff is a buff addon to monitor you, your party or raids buffs easily and quickly allowing you to cast those that are missing - all classes are supported.

Bind a key and it checks if you, a party/raid member or pets needs your buff and casts it.
Use the options menu to configure it you like, as example: buffs, raid subgroups, pets, etc.
Run the mod when ever you wish, if nothing is buffed, there is no penalty or cooldown.
